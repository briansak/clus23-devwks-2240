2. Expand the **Ribbon** by clicking the SecureX icon at the bottom-right of the screen to see created casebooks and incidents for this environment.

3. Click on the casebooks icon on the top of the window and find the **DEVWKS-2240 Casebook** Casebook created "By Others" by searching for 'DEVWKS' in the casebook pane.

This will open up a new browser window that contains the results of our investigation into one domain and the AWS internal IP addresses from our lab.

Once the enrichment of the observables is complete, you should see your IP address denoted as a 'target' in the resulting graph.

5. Use the drop-down to show the SecureX orchestration response actions that can be ran against this host, including the one you imported and uniquely named.
